            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly learned, where there is a good Master, and an apt Scholler.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 It is the onely way to know where Nature hath bestowed the benefit of a good voyce: which guift is so rare, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand, that hath it: and in many, that excellent guift is lost because they want art to expresse Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 There is not any Musicke of Instruments whatsoeuer, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is made of the voyces of Men, where the voyces are good, and the same well sorted and ordered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The better the voyce is, the meeter it is to honour and serue God there-with: and the voyce of man is chiefely to bee imployed to that ende.</p>

                  <head>¶ Reasons briefely set downe by th'author, to perswade euery one to learne to sing.</head>
                  <p>FIrst, it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly learned, where there is a good Master, and an apt Scholler.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The exercise of singing is delightfull to Nature, &amp; good to preserue the health of Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It doth strengthen all parts of the brest, &amp; doth open the pipes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a singular good remedie for a stutting and stamering in the speech.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is the best meanes to procure a perfect pronounciation, &amp; to make a good Orator.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is the onely way to know where Nature hath bestowed the benefit of a good voyce: which guift is so rare, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand, that hath it: and in many, that excellent guift is lost because they want art to expresse Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 There is not any Musicke of Instruments whatsoeuer, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is made of the voyces of Men, where the voyces are good, and the same well sorted and ordered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The better the voyce is, the meeter it is to honour and serue God there╌with: and the voyce of man is chiefely to bee imployed to that ende.</p>

If thou desire songs of smal compasse and fit for the reach of most voyces, heere are most in number of that sort. Whatsoeuer paines I haue taken heerein, I shall thinke to be well imployed, if the same bee well accepted, Musicke thereby the better loued, and the more exercised. In the expressing of these songs, either by voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Instruments, if there happen to bee any iarre or dissonance, blame not the Printer, who (I doe assure thee) through his great paines and diligence, doth heere deliuer to thee a perfect and true Coppie. If in the composition of these Songs, there bee any fault by mee committed, I desire the skilfull, eyther with courtesie to let the same bee concealed, or in friendly sort to bee thereof admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: and at the next Impression he shall finde the error reformed: remembring alwaies, that it is more easie to finde a fault then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.

                  <p>FIrst, it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly learned, where there is a good Master, and an apt Scholler.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The exercise of singing is delightfull to Nature, &amp; good to preserue the health of Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It doth strengthen all parts of the brest, &amp; doth open the pipes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a singular good remedie for a stutting and stamering in the speech.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is the best meanes to procure a perfect pronounciation, &amp; to make a good Orator.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is the onely way to know where Nature hath bestowed the benefit of a good voyce: which guift is so rare, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand, that hath it: and in many, that excellent guift is lost because they want art to expresse Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 There is not any Musicke of Instruments whatsoeuer, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is made of the voyces of Men, where the voyces are good, and the same well sorted and ordered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The better the voyce is, the meeter it is to honour and serue God there-with: and the voyce of man is chiefely to bee imployed to that ende.</p>

In the expressing of these songs, either by voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Instruments, if there happen to bee any iarre or dissonance, blame not the Printer, who (I doe assure thee) through his great paines and diligence, doth heere deliuer to thee a perfect and true Coppie. If in the composition of these Songs, there bee any fault by mee committed, I desire the skilfull, eyther with courtesie to let the same bee concealed, or in friendly sort to bee thereof admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: and at the next Impression he shall finde the error reformed: remembring alwaies, that it is more easie to finde a fault then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it. If thou finde any thing heere worthie of liking and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, giue praise vnto GOD, from whom (as from a most pure and plentifull fountaine) all good guiftes of Sciences dooe flow: whose name bee glorified for euer.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly, learned, where there is a good Master, and an apt Scholler.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The exercise of singing is delightfull to Nature, &amp; good to preserue the health of Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It doth strengthen all parts of the brest, &amp; doth open the pipes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a singular good remedie for a stutting and stamering in the speech.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is the best meanes to procure a perfect pronounciation, &amp; to make a good Orator.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is the onely way to know where Nature hath bestowed the benefit of a good voyce: which guift is so rare, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand, that hath it: and in many, that excellent guift is lost because they want art to expresse Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 There is not any Musicke of Instruments whatsoeuer, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is made of the voyces of Men, where the voyces are good, and the same well sorted and ordered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The better the voyce is, the meeter it is to honour and serue God there-with: and the voyce of man is chiefely to bee imployed to that ende.</p>

                  <head>¶ Reasons briefely set downe by th'author, to perswade euery one to learne to sing.</head>
                  <p>FIrst, it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly learned, where there is a good Master, and an apt Scholler.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The exercise of singing is delightfull to Nature, &amp; good to preserue the health of Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It doth strengthen all parts of the brest, &amp; doth open the pipes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a singular good remedie for a stutting and stamering in the speech.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is the best meanes to procure a perfect pronounciation, &amp; to make a good Orator.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is the onely way to know where Nature hath bestowed the benefit of a good voyce: which guift is so rare, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand, that hath it: and in many, that excellent guift is lost because they want art to expresse Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 There is not any Musicke of Instruments whatsoeuer, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is made of the voyces of Men, where the voyces are good, and the same well sorted and ordered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The better the voyce is, the meeter it is to honour and serue God there-with: and the voyce of man is chiefely to bee imployed to that ende.</p>

If thou desire songs of smal compasse and fit for the reach of most voyces, heere are most in number of that sort.

In the expressing of these songs, either by voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Instruments, if there happen to bee any iarre or dissonance, blame not the Printer, who (I doe assure thee) through his great paines and diligence, doth heere deliuer to thee a perfect and true Coppie.
